# React Pok√©dex

![Print](./images/print.png)

A Pok√©dex is an electronic device built to catalog and provide information about different species of pok√©mons that exist around the world.

And, why I'm made this project:

- I just discovered a free api name [Pok√©Api](https://pokeapi.co/), that have informations about almost all pok√©mons and pokeuniverse;
- This project is a way that i can improve my frontend abilities;
- I'm a pokemon fan since childhood.
